# ðŸ“„ CSVC - CSV Parser Library for Go

A high-performance, RFC 4180 compliant CSV parsing library written in Go. CSVC focuses on predictable throughput and minimal allocations, making it a practical replacement for the standard `encoding/csv` reader when processing large datasets or streaming CSV payloads.

## Features

- Handles RFC 4180 constructs: quoted fields, embedded delimiters, CRLF endings, and multi-line values.
- Supports custom field delimiters (`Reader.Comma`) and quote characters (`Reader.Quote`).
- Minimises allocations via reusable record buffers (`Reader.ReuseRecord`) and a zero-copy string builder.
- Surfaces structured parse errors with line and column numbers (`ParseError`).
- Provides benchmarks and extensive tests to guard correctness and performance.

The time it took for the Code to produce the final result was about 45 minutes.

## API Overview

### `func NewReader(src *io.Reader) *Reader`

Creates a new reader backed by an aggressively sized internal buffer. Passing a pointer keeps the underlying source swappable while avoiding unnecessary interface boxing.

### `func (r *Reader) Read() ([]string, error)`

Parses the next CSV record and returns it as a slice of strings. When the input is exhausted, it returns `io.EOF`. If `ReuseRecord` is enabled, the returned slice is reused on subsequent callsâ€”copy data you need before calling `Read` again.

### `type ParseError`

```go
type ParseError struct {
    Line   int // 1-based line number where parsing failed
    Column int // 1-based column within the current record
    Err    error // one of ErrBareQuote, ErrUnterminatedQuote, or an I/O error
}
```

`ParseError` implements `error` and supports `errors.Is` / `errors.As`.

### Sentinel Errors

- `ErrBareQuote`: encountered an unexpected quote in an unquoted field.
- `ErrUnterminatedQuote`: hit EOF while a quoted field remained open.

## Usage Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "strings"

    "csvc"
)

func main() {
    var src io.Reader = strings.NewReader("name,price\nWidget,12.50\n")
    reader := csvc.NewReader(&src)

    for {
     record, err := reader.Read()
     if err == io.EOF {
      break
     }
     if err != nil {
      panic(err)
     }
     fmt.Println(record)
    }
}
```

For larger workloads, enable `reader.ReuseRecord = true` to reduce allocationsâ€”remember to copy fields before the next `Read` call if you need them later.

## Benchmarks

Run the bundled benchmarks to compare CSVC with the standard library reader:

```bash
go test -run=^$ -bench=. -benchmem
```

Sample output on an 11th Gen Intel i5 (Windows):

```text
BenchmarkReader-8        259594 ns/op   169.62 MB/s   66622 B/op       5 allocs/op
BenchmarkEncodingCSV-8   232113 ns/op   189.70 MB/s  135801 B/op    2063 allocs/op
```

The standard reader remains slightly faster in raw throughput, while CSVC reduces heap allocations by several orders of magnitudeâ€”helpful for GC-bound workloads.

## Testing

All behaviour is covered by table-driven unit tests. Execute the suite with:

```bash
go test ./...
```
